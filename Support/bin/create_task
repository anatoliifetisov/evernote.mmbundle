		-- set theNote to (create note with text theText title theName notebook "Inbox")
		-- Note (benny): I removed the “notebook "Inbox"” part, because it didn't work if another notebook existed with "Inbox" in its name
		--  Ideally, the notebook used should be configurable.

		-- Alternative: with html "<strong>Here is my new HTML note</strong>"
		set the source URL of theNote to theMessageURL
		set the creation date of theNote to theDate
		set the modification date of theNote to theDate

		-- When MailMate is better at providing tag names then this might be useful:
		-- set theTag to make tag with properties {name:"AppleScriptTag1"}
		-- assign theTag to theNote
		-- assign {theTag, theTag2} to theNote

		open note window with theNote
